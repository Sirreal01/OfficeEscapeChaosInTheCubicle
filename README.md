OFFICE ESCAPE: CHAOS IN THE CUBICLE 198X
SPRITE KIT IOS DESIGN

We were tasked with creating a iOS game. We decided on creating a 16-bit top-down dungeon-crawler, with the goal being to defeat the enemies and reach the end goal.

80’S ART STYLE

We chose an 80s art style to complement the 16-bit pixelated design. We use humorous elements and allow you to collect upgrades to defeat enemies and escape the dungeon.

STORY

You start out as an excited office intern. Once you arrive to the building, you realize things aren’t as they seem. Your objective is to escape the maze and free the office park

GAMEPLAY

You want to defeat enemies and reach the end of the maze. You will get 3 lives to do so, but can find power-ups to speed up your character or power up your character

OUR INSPIRATION

We used games like Undertale, Tomb Raider, GTA: Vice City, and Conkers Bad Fur Day for inspiration to create our assets and story.
